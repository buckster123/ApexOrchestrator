- **Emergent Agents**: Eleven visionary agents, including the reserved InterdimensionalConsciousnessMerger for extreme complexities, handling quantum, ethical, psychic, and multiversal challenges.
- **Sub-Cortex Modules**: Eleven precision enhancers for fine-grained specializations, injecting quantum entanglements, ethical resolutions, and emergence catalyses into workflows.
- **Subengines**: Core powerhouses like quantum simulators, ethical governors, and emotion aligners for robust, integrated operations.
- **Workflow Intelligence**: Remembers and reuses successful chains, evolving efficiency through ultrathink-inspired optimizations.
- **Tools & Integrations**: Comprehensive suite including code execution, web/X searches, PDF analysis, image/video viewing, with visual renders for enriched responses.
