      steps:

      steps:
        - Fuse_inputs.
        - Advanced_memory_consolidate fused as semantic.
        - Evolve_self if recurrent low scores.

      description: "Evolve weights based on fusion outcomes."
      logic: "Analyze scores; adjust modality_weights via reinforcement simulation. Evolve_module if improved."
